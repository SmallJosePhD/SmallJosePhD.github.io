# Introduction
The Multiple Threshold Nonlinear ARDL (MT-NARDL) approach, introduced by Verheyen (2013), extends the ARDL to incorporate nonlinearity, building upon the Nonlinear ARDL (NARDL) model. 
<!--more-->
Unlike NARDL, which focuses on decomposing the series around zero, with an emphasis on the median value as the threshold point, the MT-NARDL model extends its focus to include more than one threshold point. The graphical representation below illustrates the concept of MTARDL, where each vertical line represents a threshold point in the series distribution. While arbitrary partitioning is possible, it is more reasonable to opt for sensible partitioning. This post adopts the approach of partitioning into quantiles for a more justified and appealing analysis.

# The method 
Let $x$ be the series of interest to be portioned into sub-units, and let the $Q(τ|Δx)$ be the $τ$ quantile of $Δx$. The portion of $x$ below the quantile is given by:


$$x_t ^{Q(\tau_b|\Delta x)}=\sum_{j=1}^t\{\Delta x_j<Q(\tau_b|\Delta x)\}\Delta x_j$$

Above a given quantile, the generated series is given by:
$$x_t ^{Q(\tau_a|\Delta x)}=\sum_{j=1}^t\{\Delta x_j>Q(\tau_a|\Delta x)\}\Delta x_j$$


For the regime that lies in between, the generated series is given by:

$$x_t ^{Q_{a|b}(\tau|\Delta x)}=\sum_{j=1}^t\{Q(\tau_a|\Delta x)<\Delta x_j<Q(\tau_b|\Delta x)\}\Delta x_j$$

## Long-run Relationship
Assume our focus is on examining the connection between $y$ and $x$, particularly exploring the quantile-based impact of $x$ on $y$. The relevant long-run relationship can be expressed as:

$$y_t =\alpha +\beta x_t^{Q(t_a)}+\chi x_t^{Q(t_b)}+\gamma x_t^{Q(t_{a|b})}+\epsilon_t$$

Adopting an ARDL framework for the model, we have an ARDL(k,l,m,n) as specified:

$$y_t =\lambda +\sum_{j=1}^k \varphi_j y_{t-j}+\sum_{j=0}^l \phi_j x_{t-j}^{Q(t_a)}+\sum_{j=0}^m \psi_j x_{t-j}^{Q(t_b)}+\sum_{j=0}^n \eta_j  x_{t-j}^{Q(t_{a|b})}+\epsilon_t$$

The equation above can be re-parameterised as:
$$y_t =\lambda +\sum_{j=1}^k \varphi_j y_{t-j}+\sum_{j=0}^l \phi_j x_{t-j}^{Q(t_a)}+\sum_{j=0}^m \psi_j x_{t-j}^{Q(t_b)}+\sum_{j=0}^n \eta_j  x_{t-j}^{Q(t_{a|b})}+\epsilon_t$$
 

To test for the presence or otherwise of a cointegrating relationship between the series, based on Pesaran et al. (2001), the following hypothesis is tested:

$$\theta_1 = \theta_2 = \theta_3 = \theta_4 =0$$

To rule out the degenerate cases by t-ratio tests of each of the level variables in the model, an inbuilt Eviews code needed most for the implementation of the MT-NARDL is given as:

```
Q(τ|x)=@quantile(x,τ)$$
```

# Implementing of the MT-NARDL in EViews
So, the implementation of the MT-NARDL follows simple five steps:

1. First, decide on the variable to decompose (for instance, exchange rate, interest rate, etc.), and the thresholds (25% and 75%; or 20% and 80%). In other words, determine which variable (your interest variables) you want to decompose to various thresholds (Let's denote this variable as $x$).
2. Second, compute the first difference of the variable (i.e., $Δx$)
3. Third, compute the thresholds for the variables. This can be done in EViews using the formula below

```series Q1 = @quantile(Δx,τ1)```

```series Q2 = @quantile(Δx,τ2)```

Please note that the quantile is computed from the difference ($Δx$) and **NOT** $x$.

4. Based on the computed threshold value for $Δx$ above, generate the series for the lower-tail regime, upper-tail regime, and the inner-corridor:
    
    a. series for the lower-tail regime:
``` series x_lw=@cumsum((Δx<Q1)*Δx) ```
    
    b. series for the upper-tail regime:
``` series x_up=@cumsum((Δx>Q2)*Δx) ```

    c. series for the inner-corridor regime:
```
series x_in=@cumsum(((Δx>Q1) and (Δx<Q2))*Δx)
```


**Note:** There can be more than one inner-corridor regime if there are more than two threshold points. For instance, if there is a third threshold ($Q3$), the two inner-corridor regimes will be given by

```
series x_in1=@cumsum(((Δx>Q1) and (Δx<Q2))*Δx)

series x_in2=@cumsum(((Δx>Q2) and (Δx<Q3))*Δx)
```

5. Lastly, after computing the series for all the regimes, an ARDL model can be estimated within the ARDL equation environment in EViews. This can be done by typing the following in the equation Estimation dialog box, for two-threshold/three-regime model:

```
 y x_lw x_up x_in
```

and the following for a three-threshold/four-regime model:

 ``` 
 y x_lw x_up x_in1 x_in2
 ```



## .... the EViews program for the implementation
I wrote an EViews program to perform all steps on the go. You can download the program file [here](files/private/mt-nardl%20program%20code%20%5Bnew%5D.prg). It is, however, presented below:
