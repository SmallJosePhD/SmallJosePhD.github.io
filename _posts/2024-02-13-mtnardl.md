# Introduction
The Multiple Threshold Nonlinear ARDL (MT-NARDL) approach, introduced by Verheyen (2013), extends the ARDL to incorporate nonlinearity, building upon the Nonlinear ARDL (NARDL) model.

Unlike NARDL, which focuses on decomposing the series around zero, with an emphasis on the median value as the threshold point, the MT-NARDL model extends its focus to include more than one threshold point. The graphical representation below illustrates the concept of MTARDL, where each vertical line represents a threshold point in the series distribution. While arbitrary partitioning is possible, it is more reasonable to opt for sensible partitioning. This post adopts the approach of partitioning into quantiles for a more justified and appealing analysis.
