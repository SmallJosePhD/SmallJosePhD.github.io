abstract: 'Utilizing  a  nonlinear  autoregressive  distributed  lag  (NARDL)  model,  this study aims to find out if the shadow economy's (SE) effect on Malaysia's economic growth is not linear from 1970 to 2022. This model uniquely identifies potential nonlinearities or  asymmetries  in the relationship between SE and growth. The results  of the bounds tests show that there is a strong long-term link between economic growth and both good and bad changes in the SE, as well as variables like inflation, urban population growth in cities,  financial  development,  and  economic uncertainty.  Furthermore,  the  results indicate that the SE’s influence on growth is nonlinear, both in the short and long term. In particular, both growing  and shrinking the  SE have positive effects  on growth, but growing the SE has a bigger long-term effect than shrinking it. Conversely, in the short term, reductions in the SE’s size have a greater impact. Additionally, inflation, urban population  growth,  financial  development,  and  economic  uncertainties  emerge  as  key determinants of growth across both time horizons. These findings suggest the need for policies that reduce the size of the shadow economy and encourage the shift from informal to formal economic activities to foster sustained economic growth.'
