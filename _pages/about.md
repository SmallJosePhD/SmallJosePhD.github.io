My name is **Joseph David** (christened Joseph Tolúwaṣẹ Ọláolúwa Babátúndé David). I am a Research Associate at the Covenant University's <a href ="https://cepder.covenantuniversity.edu.ng/" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank"> Centre for Economic Policy and Development Research (CEPDeR)</a>. 

<!--I am currently pursuing a Masters by Research (MRes) degree at the <a href ="https://fpe.upsi.edu.my/master/"  style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank"></a>Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI), Malaysia.--!> 

I was previously affiliated with the <a href="https://lbs.edu.ng" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">Lagos Business School, Pan-Atlantic University</a>, Lagos, where I worked as a Research and Teaching Assistant under the mentorship of <a href ="https://www.lbs.edu.ng/faculty_profiles/akintola-owolabi/"  style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">Professor Akintola Owolabi</a>. I left the Lagos Business School for a graduate degree program in August 2023. However, Professor Owowlabi continues to mentor me. <br/> <br/>

Before joining the Lagos Business School, I was mentored by <a href="https://scholar.google.com.my/citations?user=U2rrsr4AAAAJ&hl=en" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">Professor Nurudeen Abu</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=jklNds0AAAAJ" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank"> Dr. Musa Abdullahi Sakanko</a>. Under the mentorship of Professor Abu and Dr. Sakanko, I have contributed to answering several interesting research questions.     

<h3>Research Theme</h3>
The central theme of my research interests broadly lies at the intersection of illicit activities (such as corruption, money laundering, and underground economic activities), climate change, and fiscal sustainability in developing economies.
<br/><br/>

Building on my strong background and interest in econometric theory, political economy and development economics, I have, since 2017 (after my bachelor's degree), employed quantitative economics toolkits to understand the complexity of several social, economic, and political issues. These include the drivers and inhibitors of poverty in Nigeria, the health spending-outcome nexus, the implication of the oil-corruption association for fiscal and economic sustainability; and the size of money laundering, amongst others. 

<br/><br/>
My research projects have appeared in some notable Economic journals, including the Journal of Money Laundering Control, Economic Change and Restructuring, Contemporary Economics, and the International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy, among others.

Gamal</a>, focuses on the role of corruption and the underground economy in the oil rent-growth relationship in oil-rich economies.--!>
