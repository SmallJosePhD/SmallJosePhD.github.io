Since 2014, I have taught basic and applied undergraduate Economics courses (including introductory, intermediate, and advanced micro- and macro-economics, mathematics, statistics, and econometrics), data science courses, and high school economics. While at Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University during my Bachelor's degree programme, I tutored colleagues and students taking elective courses in the Department of Economics. 

I also served as a support Economics teacher during my compulsory one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in one of the secondary schools in the educationally disadvantaged and war-torn Zamfara state, in Northern Nigeria. I have also served as a teaching assistant at the Lagos Business School, Pan-Atlantic University, where I assist Professor Akintola Owolabi in preparing lecture material, presentations, and case studies, amongst others. I have also held sessions at the two-week Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS), Calabar location, where I walked participants through the basics and advanced techniques in data sciences.
